<h4>REMARKS.</h4>

<p>Although "The Bold Stroke for a Husband," by
Mrs. Cowley, does not equal "The Bold Stroke for a
Wife," by Mrs. Centlivre, either in originality of
design, wit, or humour, it has other advantages more
honourable to her sex, and more conducive to the
reputation of the stage.</p>

<p>Here is contained no oblique insinuation, detrimental
to the cause of morality&mdash;but entertainment
and instruction unite, to make a pleasant exhibition
at a theatre, or give an hour's amusement in the
closet.</p>

<p>Plays, where the scene is placed in a foreign
country, particularly when that country is Spain,
have a license to present certain improbabilities to
the audience, without incurring the danger of having
them called such; and the authoress, by the skill
with which she has used this dramatic permittance,
in making the wife of Don Carlos pass for a man,
has formed a most interesting plot, and embellished
it with lively, humorous, and affecting incident.</p>

<p>Still there is another plot, of which Olivia is the
heroine, as Victoria is of the foregoing; and this
more comic fable, in which the former is chiefly
concerned, seems to have been the favourite story of
the authoress, as from this she has taken her title.</p>

<p>But if Olivia makes a bold stroke to obtain a husband,
surely Victoria makes a still bolder, to preserve
one; and there is something less honourable in the
enterprises of the young maiden, in order to renounce
her state, than in those of a married woman
to avert the dangers that are impending over hers.</p>

<p>Whichever of those females becomes the most admired
object with the reader, he will not be insensible
to the trials of the other, or to the various interests
of the whole dramatis person&aelig;, to whom the
writer has artfully given a kind of united influence;
and upon a happy combination it is, that sometimes,
the success of a drama more depends, than upon the
most powerful support of any particularly prominent,
yet insulated, character.</p>

<p>The part of Don Vincentio was certainly meant as
a moral satire upon the extravagant love or the foolish
affectation, of pretending to love, to extravagance&mdash;music.
This satire was aimed at so many,
that the shaft struck none. The charm of music
still prevails in England, and the folly of affected
admirers.</p>

<p>Vincentio talks music, and Don Julio speaks
poetry. Such, at least, is his fond description of
his mistress Olivia, in that excellent scene in the
third act, where she first takes off her veil, and fascinates
him at once by the force of her beauty.</p>

<p>In the delineation of this lady, it is implied that
she is no termagant, although she so frequently
counterfeits the character. This insinuation the
reader, if he pleases, may trust&mdash;but the man
who would venture to marry a good impostor of
this kind, could not excite much pity, if his helpmate
was often induced to act the part which she
had heretofore, with so much spirit, assumed.</p>

<p>The impropriety of making fraud and imposition
necessary evils, to counteract tyranny and injustice,
is the fault of all Spanish dramas&mdash;and perhaps the
only one which attaches to the present comedy.</p>

grace? I have been studying it now for a whole week,
and I'll defy don or devil to surprise me into a truth.

<p><i>Car.</i> It must be a lie, by your promptness in delivering
it.&mdash;What a fool does your mistress trust&mdash;A
clever rascal would have waited my approach,
and, delivering the message with easy coolness, deceived
me&mdash;<i>thou</i> hast been on the watch, and runnest

be longer, if you do not tell me who is with her in
the grotto.</p>

<p><i>Ped.</i> In the grotto, sir!&mdash;did I say any thing
about the grotto? I<span class="nowrap">&mdash;&mdash;</span>I only meant that<span class="nowrap">&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p><i>Car.</i> Fool!&mdash;dost thou trifle with me? who is with
her? [<i>Pinching his ear.</i>]</p>

<p><i>Ped.</i> Oh!&mdash;why, nobody, sir&mdash;only the pretty
young gentleman's valet, waiting for an answer to
a letter he brought. There! I have saved my ears
at the expense of my place. I have worn this fine
coat but a week, and I shall be sent back to Segovia
for not being able to lie, though I have been learning
the art six days and nights.</p>

<p><i>Car.</i> Well&mdash;come this way&mdash;if thou wilt promise
to be faithful to me, I will not betray thee: nor at
present enter the house.</p>

<p><i>Ped.</i> Oh, sir, blessings on you!</p>

<p><i>Car.</i> How often does the pretty young gentleman
visit her?</p>

<p><i>Ped.</i> Every day, sir&mdash;If he misses, madam's stark
wild.</p>

<p><i>Car.</i> Where does he live?</p>

<p><i>Ped.</i> Truly, I know not, sir.</p>

<p><i>Car.</i> How! [<i>Menacing.</i>]</p>

<p><i>Ped.</i> By the honesty of my mother, I cannot tell,
sir. She calls him Florio;&mdash;that's his christian name&mdash;his
heathen name I never heard.</p>

<p><i>Car.</i> You must acquaint me when they are next
together.</p>

<p><i>Ped.</i> Lord, sir, if there should be any blood spilt!</p>

<p><i>Car.</i> Promise,&mdash;or I'll lead thee by the ears to the
grotto.</p>

<p><i>Ped.</i> I promise, I promise.</p>

<p><i>Car.</i> There, take that, [<i>Gives money.</i>] and if thou
art faithful, I'll treble it. Now go in and be a good
lad&mdash;and, d'ye hear?&mdash;you may tell lies to every
body else, but remember you must always speak

<p><i>Julio.</i> [<i>Returning.</i>] Don Carlos? Yes, by all the
sober gods of matrimony!&mdash;Why, what business,
goodman gravity, canst thou have in Madrid? I understand
you are married&mdash;quietly settled in your
own pastures&mdash;father of a family, and the instructive
companion of country vine dressers&mdash;ha! ha!</p>

<p><i>Car.</i> 'Tis false, by Heaven!&mdash;I have forsworn the
country&mdash;left my family, and run away from my
wife.</p>

<p><i>Julio.</i> Really! then matrimony has not totally destroyed
thy free will.</p>

<p><i>Car.</i> 'Tis with difficulty I have preserved it
though; for women, thou knowest, are most unreasonable
beings! as soon as I had exhausted my stock
of love tales, which, with management, lasted beyond
the honey-moon, madam grew sullen,&mdash;I found
home dull, and amused myself with the pretty peasants
of the neighbourhood<span class="nowrap">&mdash;&mdash;</span>Worse and worse!&mdash;we
had nothing now but faintings, tears and hysterics,
for twenty-four honey-moons more.&mdash;So one morning
I gave her in her sleep a farewell kiss, to comfort
her when she should awake, and posted to Madrid;
where, if it was not for the remembrance of the clog
at my heel, I should bound o'er the regions of pleasure,
with more spirit than a young Arabian on his
mountains.</p>

<p><i>Julio.</i> Do you find this clog no hindrance in affairs
of gallantry?</p>

<p><i>Car.</i> Not much.&mdash;In that house there&mdash;but, damn
her, she's perfidious!&mdash;in that house is a woman of
beauty, with pretensions to character and fortune,
who devoted herself to my passion.</p>

<p><i>Julio.</i> If she's perfidious, give her to the winds.</p>

<p><i>Car.</i> Ah, but there is a rub, Julio, I have been a
fool&mdash;a woman's fool!&mdash;In a state of intoxication,
she wheedled me, or rather cheated me, out of a settlement.</p>

<p><i>Julio.</i> Pho! is that<span class="nowrap">&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p><i>Car.</i> Oh! but you know not its nature. A settlement
of lands, that both honour and gratitude ought
to have preserved sacred from such base alienation.

forgotten; but if a man does a foolish thing once,
he'll hear of it all his life.</p>

<p><i>Julio.</i> Ay, the time has been when thou might'st
have been intrusted with such a dear secret,&mdash;when
I might have opened the billet, and feasted thee
with the sweet meandering strokes at the bottom,
which form her name, when<span class="nowrap">&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p><i>Julio.</i> It is.</p>

<p><i>Julio.</i> Hum&mdash;not absolutely handsome, but she'll

by&mdash;matrimony.</p>

she can be so bewitching a creature?</p>

<p><i>Julio.</i> 'Tis possible&mdash;though, to deal plainly, I
never saw her: but I love my own pleasure so well,
that I could fancy all that, and ten times more.</p>

<p><i>Car.</i> What star does she inhabit?</p>

waiting, at seven, at the Prado.</p>

<p><i>Car.</i> Prado!&mdash;hey!&mdash;gad! can't you take me
with you? for though I have forsworn the sex myself,
and have done with them for ever, yet I may be
of use to you, you know.</p>

<p><i>Julio.</i> 'Faith, I can't see that&mdash;however, as you
are a poor wo-begone married mortal, I'll have
compassion, and suffer thee to come.</p>

<p><i>Car.</i> Then I am a man again! Wife, avaunt!

<p><i>Min.</i> There, will that do! My lady sent me to

and this rose, how sweet?</p>

<p><i>Inis.</i> Pho! what signifies wearing sweets in her
bosom, unless they would sweeten her manners?&mdash;'tis
amazing you can be so much at your ease; one
might think your lady's tongue was a lute, and her
morning scold an agreeable serenade.</p>

<p><i>Min.</i> So they are&mdash;Custom, you know. I have
been used to her music now these two years, and I
don't believe I could relish my breakfast without it.</p>

<p><i>Inis.</i> I would rather never break my fast, than do
it on such terms. What a difference between your
mistress and mine! Donna Victoria is as much too
gentle, as her cousin is too harsh.</p>

<p><i>Min.</i> Ay, and you see what she gets by it; had
she been more spirited, perhaps her husband would
not have forsaken her;&mdash;men enlisted under the
matrimonial banner, like those under the king's,
would be often tempted to run away from their
colours, if fear did not keep them in dread of desertion.</p>

happiest wife in Spain.</p>

<p><i>Min.</i> Ha! ha! ha! how people may be deceived!&mdash;nay,
how people are deceived!&mdash;but time will
discover all things.</p>

<p><i>Inis.</i> What! what, is there a secret in the business,
Minette? if there is, hang time! let's have it
directly.</p>

<p><i>Min.</i> Now, if I dared but tell ye&mdash;lud! lud! how
I could surprise ye!<span class="nowrap">&mdash;&mdash;</span>[<i>Going.</i>]</p>

<p><i>Inis.</i> [<i>Stopping her.</i>] Don't go.</p>

<p><i>Min.</i> I must go; I am on the very brink of betraying
my mistress,&mdash;I must leave you&mdash;mercy
upon me!&mdash;it rises like new bread.</p>

<p><i>Inis.</i> I hope it will choke ye, if you stir till I

<p><i>Min.</i> Will you never breathe a syllable?</p>

<p><i>Inis.</i> Never.</p>

<p><i>Min.</i> Will you strive to forget it the moment you
have heard it?</p>

<p><i>Inis.</i> I'll swear to myself forty times a-day to forget
it.</p>

<p><i>Min.</i> You are sure you will not let me stir from
this spot till you know the whole?</p>

<p><i>Inis.</i> Not as far as a thrush hops.</p>

<p><i>Min.</i> So! now, then, in one word,&mdash;here it goes.

<p><i>Min.</i> Oh, St. Gerome!&mdash;here is her father, and
his privy counsellor, Gasper. I can never communicate
a secret in quiet. Well! come to my chamber,
for, now my hand's in, you shall have the
whole.&mdash;I would not keep it another day to be confidant
to an infanta.</p>

</div>

<p><i>Gasp.</i> Take comfort, sir; take comfort.</p>

<p><i>C&aelig;sar.</i> Take it;&mdash;why, where the devil shall I
find it? You may say, take physic, sir, or, take poison,
sir<span class="nowrap">&mdash;&mdash;</span>they are to be had; but what signifies
bidding me take comfort, when I can neither buy it,
beg it, nor steal it?</p>

<p><i>Gasp.</i> But patience will bring it, sir.</p>

<p><i>C&aelig;sar.</i> 'Tis false, sirrah.&mdash;Patience is a cheat,
and the man that ranked her with the cardinal virtues
was a fool. I have had patience at bed and
board these three long years, but the comfort she
promised, has never called in with a civil how d'ye?</p>

<p><i>Gasp.</i> Ay, sir, but you know the poets say that
the twin sister and companion of comfort is good
humour. Now if you would but drop that agreeable
acidity, which is so conspicuous<span class="nowrap">&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p><i>C&aelig;sar.</i> Then let my daughter drop her perverse
humour; 'tis a more certain bar to marriage than
ugliness or folly; and will send me to my grave, at
last, without male heirs. [<i>Crying.</i>] How many have
laid siege to her! But that humour of hers, like the
works of Gibraltar, no Spaniard can find pregnable.</p>

<p><i>Gasp.</i> Ay, well&mdash;Troy held out but ten years<span class="nowrap">&mdash;&mdash;</span>Let
her once tell over her beads, unmarried at five-and-twenty,
and, my life upon it, she ends the rosary,
with a hearty prayer for a good husband.</p>

<p><i>C&aelig;sar.</i> What, d'ye expect me to wait till the horrors
of old maidenism frighten her into civility? no,
no;&mdash;I'll shut her up in a convent, marry myself,
and have heirs in spite of her. There's my neighbour
Don Vasquez's daughter, she is but nineteen<span class="nowrap">&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p><i>Gasp.</i> The very step I was going to recommend,
sir. You are but a young gentleman of sixty-three,
I take it; and a husband of sixty-three, who marries
a wife of nineteen, will never want heirs, take
my word for it.</p>

<p><i>C&aelig;sar.</i> What! do you joke, sirrah?</p>

<p><i>Gasp.</i> Oh no, sir&mdash;not if you are serious. I
think it would be one of the pleasantest things in
the world&mdash;Madam would throw a new life into the
family; and when you are above stairs in the gout,
sir, the music of her concerts, and the spirit of her
converzationes, would reach your sick bed, and be
a thousand times more comforting than flannels and
panada.</p>

<p><i>C&aelig;sar.</i> Come, come, I understand ye.&mdash;But this
daughter of mine&mdash;I shall give her but two chances
more.<span class="nowrap">&mdash;&mdash;</span>Don Garcia and Don Vincentio will both
be here to-day, and if she plays over the old game,
I'll marry to-morrow morning, if I hang myself the
next.</p>

<p><i>Gasp.</i> You decide right, signor; at sixty-three the
marriage noose and the hempen noose should always
go together.</p>

<p><i>C&aelig;sar.</i> Why, you dog you, do you suppose&mdash;There's
Don Garcia&mdash;there he is coming through
the portico. Run to my daughter, and bid her remember
what I have said to her. [<i>Exit</i> <span class="smallcaps">Gasper, r.</span>]

mayn't be amiss&mdash;a young slut! pretty, and witty,

<p class="noindent">Welcome, Don Garcia! why, you are rather before
your time.</p>

<p><i>Gar.</i> Gallantry forbid that I should not, when a
fair lady is concerned. Should Donna Olivia welcome
me as frankly as you do, I shall think I have
been tardy.</p>

<p><i>C&aelig;sar.</i> When you made your overtures, signor, I
understood it was from inclination to be allied to
my family, not from a particular passion to my
daughter. Have you ever seen her?</p>

<p><i>Gar.</i> But once&mdash;that transiently&mdash;yet sufficient
to convince me that she is charming.</p>

<p><i>C&aelig;sar.</i> Why, yes, though I say it, there are few
prettier women in Madrid; and she has got enemies
amongst her own sex accordingly. They pretend
to say that<span class="nowrap">&mdash;&mdash;</span>I say, sir, they have reported that
she is not blessed with that kind of docility and gentleness
that a<span class="nowrap">&mdash;&mdash;</span>now, though she may not be so
very placid, and insipid, as some young women, yet,
upon the whole&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Gar.</i> Oh, fie, sir!&mdash;not a word&mdash;a beauty cannot
be ill-tempered; gratified vanity keeps her in good
humour with herself, and every body about her.</p>

<p><i>C&aelig;sar.</i> Yes, as you say&mdash;vanity is a prodigious
sweetener; and Olivia, considering how much she
has been humoured, is as gentle and pliant as<span class="nowrap">&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p><i>C&aelig;sar.</i> Hush!</p>

<p><i>Min.</i> No, sir, I can't hush&mdash;a saint could not

her service.</p>

<p><i>Oliv.</i> Oh, you vile creature!&mdash;to speak to me!&mdash;to
answer me!&mdash;am I made to be answered?</p>

<p><i>C&aelig;sar.</i> Daughter! daughter!</p>

<p><i>Oliv.</i> Because I threw my work-bag at her, she
had the insolence to complain; and, on my repeating
it, said she would not bear it.&mdash;Servants choose
what they shall bear!</p>

<p><i>Min.</i> When you are married, ma'am, I hope your
husband will bear your humour less patiently than
I have done.</p>

<p><i>Oliv.</i> My husband!&mdash;dost think my husband shall
contradict my will? Oh, I long to set a pattern to
those milky wives, whose mean compliances degrade
the sex.</p>

<p><i>Gar.</i> Opportune! [<i>Aside.</i>]</p>

<p><i>Oliv.</i> The only husband on record who knew how
to treat a wife was Socrates; and though his lady
was a Grecian, I have some reason to believe her
descendants matched into our family; and never
shall my tame submission disgrace my ancestry.</p>

<p><i>Gar.</i> Heavens! why have you never curbed this
intemperate spirit, Don C&aelig;sar? [<span class="smallcaps">r.</span> <i>of</i> <span class="smallcaps">Olivia</span>.]</p>

<p><i>Oliv.</i> [<i>Starting.</i>] Curbed, sir! talk thus to your
groom&mdash;curbs and bridles for a woman's tongue!</p>

<p><i>Gar.</i> Not for yours, lady, truly! 'tis too late.
But had the torrent, not so overbearing, been taken
at its spring, it might have been stemmed, and turned
in gentle streamlets at the master's pleasure.</p>

<p><i>Oliv.</i> A mistake, friend!&mdash;my spirit, at its spring,
was too powerful for any master.</p>

<p><i>Gar.</i> Indeed!&mdash;perhaps you may meet a Petruchio,
gentle Catherine, yet.</p>

<p><i>Oliv.</i> But no gentle Catherine will he find me, believe
it.<span class="nowrap">&mdash;&mdash;</span>Catherine! why, she had not the spirit
of a roasted chestnut&mdash;a few big words, an empty
oath, and a scanty dinner, made her as submissive
as a spaniel. My fire will not be so soon extinguished&mdash;it
shall resist big words, oaths, and starving.</p>

<p><i>Min.</i> I believe so, indeed; help the poor gentleman,
I say, to whose fate you fall! [<i>Returns up.</i>]</p>

<p><i>Gar.</i> Don C&aelig;sar, adieu! My commiseration for
your fate subdues the resentment I should otherwise
feel at your endeavouring to deceive me into
such a marriage. [<i>Crosses</i>, <span class="smallcaps">l.</span>]</p>

<p><i>Oliv.</i> Marriage! oh, mercy!&mdash;Is this Don Garcia! [<i>Apart to</i> <span class="smallcaps">C&aelig;sar</span>.]</p>

<p><i>C&aelig;sar.</i> Yes, termagant!</p>

<p><i>Oliv.</i> O, what a misfortune! Why did you not
tell me it was the gentleman you designed to marry
me to?&mdash;Oh, sir! all that is past was in sport; a
contrivance between my maid and me: I have no
spirit at all&mdash;I am as patient as poverty.</p>

<p><i>Gar.</i> This mask fits too ill on your features, fair
lady: I have seen you without disguise, and rejoice
in your ignorance of my name, since, but for that,
my peaceful home might have become the seat of
perpetual discord.</p>

<p><i>Min.</i> Ay, sir, you would never have known what
a quiet hour<span class="nowrap">&mdash;&mdash;</span>[<i>On</i> <span class="smallcaps">r.</span> <i>of Olivia</i>.]</p>

<p><i>Oliv.</i> [<i>Strikes her.</i>] Impertinence! Indeed, sir, I
can be as gentle and forbearing as a pet lamb.</p>

<p><i>Gar.</i> I cannot doubt it, madam; the proofs of your
placidity are very striking&mdash;But adieu! though I
shall pray for your conversion, rather than have the
honour of it&mdash;I'd turn Dominican, and condemn
myself to perpetual celibacy.</p>
<p class="right">[<i>Exit</i>, <span class="smallcaps">l.</span></p>

<p><i>C&aelig;sar.</i> Now, hussy!&mdash;now, hussy!&mdash;what do you
expect?</p>

<p><i>Oliv.</i> Dear me! how can you be so unreasonable!
did ever daughter do more to oblige a father! I absolutely
begged the man to have me.</p>

<p><i>C&aelig;sar.</i> Yes, vixen! after you had made him detest
ye; what, I suppose, he did not hit your fancy,
madam; though there is not, in all Spain, a man
of prettier conversation.</p>

<p><i>Oliv.</i> Yes he has a very pretty kind of conversation;
'tis like a parenthesis.</p>

<p><i>C&aelig;sar.</i> Like a parenthesis!</p>

<p><i>Oliv.</i> Yes, it might be all left out, and never
missed. However, I thought him a modest kind of
a well-meaning young man, and that he would
make a pretty sort of a husband&mdash;for notwithstanding
his blustering, had I been his wife, in three
months he should have been as humble and complaisant
as<span class="nowrap">&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p><i>C&aelig;sar.</i> Ay, there it is&mdash;there it is!&mdash;that spirit of
yours, hussy, you can neither conquer nor conceal;
but I'll find a way to tame it, I'll warrant me.</p>

<p class="right">[<i>Exit</i>, <span class="smallcaps">r. Olivia</span> <i>and</i> <span class="smallcaps">Minette</span> <i>follow him with

<p><i>Min.</i> Well, madam, I give you joy! had other ladies
as much success in getting lovers, as you have
in getting rid of yours, what contented faces we
should see!</p>

<p><i>Oliv.</i> But to what purpose do I get rid of them,
whilst they rise in succession like monthly pinks?
Was there ever any thing so provoking? After
some quiet, and believing the men had ceased to
trouble themselves about me, no less than two proposals
have been made to my inexorable father this
very day&mdash;What will become of me?</p>

<p><i>Min.</i> What should become of you? You'll chuse
one from the pair, I hope. Believe me, madam,
the only way to get rid of the impertinence of
lovers, is to take one, and make him a scarecrow to
the rest.</p>

<p><i>Oliv.</i> Oh, but I cannot!&mdash;Invention assist me this
one day!</p>

<p><i>Min.</i> Upon my word, madam, invention owes
you nothing; and I am afraid you can draw on
that bank no longer.&mdash;You must trust to your established
character of vixen.</p>

<p><i>Oliv.</i> But that won't frighten them all, you know,
though it did its business with sober Don Garcia.
The brave General Antonio would have made a
property of me, in spite of every thing, had I not
luckily discovered his antipathy to cats, and so
scared the hero, by pretending an immoderate passion
for young kittens.</p>

<p><i>Min.</i> Yes, but you was still harder pushed by the
Castilian Count, and his engraved genealogy from
Noah.</p>

<p><i>Oliv.</i> Oh, he would have kept his post as immovably
as the griffins at his gate, had I not very seriously
imparted to him, that my mother's great uncle
sold oranges in Arragon.</p>

<p><i>Min.</i> And pray, madam, if I may be so bold, who
is the next gentleman?</p>

<p><i>Oliv.</i> Oh, Don Vincentio, who distracts every
body with his skill in music. He ought to be married
to a Viol de Gamba. I bless my stars I have
never yet had a miser in my list&mdash;on such a character
all art would be lost, and nothing but an earthquake,
to swallow up my estate, could save me.</p>

<p><i>Min.</i> Well, if some one did but know, how happy
would some one be, that for his sake<span class="nowrap">&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p><i>Oliv.</i> Now, don't be impertinent, Minette. You
have several times attempted to slide yourself into
a secret, which I am resolved to keep to myself.
Continue faithful, and suppress your curiosity.</p>
<p class="right">[<i>Exit</i>, <span class="smallcaps">r.</span></p>

<p><i>Min.</i> Suppress my curiosity, madam!&mdash;why, I
am a chambermaid, and a sorry one too, it should
seem, to have been in your confidence two years,
and never have got the master-secret yet. I never
was six weeks in a family before, but I knew every
secret they had in it for three generations; ay, and
I'll know this too, or I'll blow up all her plans, and

made thee rich, and whom thou madest thy wife.</p>

<p><i>Car.</i> My wife!&mdash;here's a turn! So to revenge the
quarrels of my wife<span class="nowrap">&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p><i>Laura.</i> No, do not mistake me&mdash;what I have
done was merely to indulge myself, without more
regard to your feelings, than you had to hers.</p>

<p><i>Car.</i> And you dare avow to my face, that you
have a passion for another?</p>

<p><i>Laura.</i> I do, and&mdash;for I am above disguise, I confess,

left a trace of that I once avowed for Carlos.</p>

<p><i>Car.</i> Well, madam, if I hear this without some
sudden vengeance on the tongue which speaks it,
thank the annihilation of that passion, whose remembrance
is as dead in my bosom as in yours. Let
us, however, part friends, and with a mutual acquittal

of that estate, which left me almost a beggar.</p>

<p><i>Oliv.</i> [<i>Speaks as entering.</i>] If my father should
inquire for me, tell him I am in Donna Victoria's
apartment.&mdash;Smiling, I protest! my dear gloomy
cousin, where have you purchased that sun-shiny
look?</p>

<p><i>Vict.</i> It is but April sunshine, I fear; but who
could resist such a temptation to smile? a letter
from Donna Laura, my husband's mistress, styling
me her dearest Florio! her life! her soul! and complaining
of a twelve hours absence, as the bitterest
misfortune.</p>

<p><i>Oliv.</i> Ha! ha! ha! most doughty Don! pray, let
us see you in your feather and doublet; as a Cavaleiro,
it seems, you are formidable. So suddenly to
rob your husband of his charmer's heart! you must
have used some witchery.</p>

<p><i>Vict.</i> Yes, powerful witchery&mdash;the knowledge of
my sex. Oh! did the men but know us, as well
as we do ourselves;&mdash;but, thank fate they do not&mdash;'twould
be dangerous.</p>

<p><i>Oliv.</i> What, I suppose, you praised her understanding,
was captivated by her wit, and absolutely
struck dumb by the amazing beauties of&mdash;her mind.</p>

<p><i>Vict.</i> Oh, no,&mdash;that's the mode prescribed by the
essayists on the female heart&mdash;ha! ha! ha!&mdash;Not a
woman breathing, from fifteen to fifty, but would
rather have a compliment to the tip of her ear, or the
turn of her ancle, than a volume in praise of her intellects.</p>

<p><i>Oliv.</i> So, flattery, then, is your boasted pill?</p>

<p><i>Vict.</i> No, that's only the occasional gilding; but
'tis in vain to attempt a description of what changed
its nature with every moment. I was now attentive&mdash;now
gay&mdash;then tender, then careless. I strove rather
to convince her that I was charming, than that
I myself was charmed; and when I saw love's arrow
quivering in her heart, instead of falling at her feet,
sung a triumphant air, and remembered a sudden
engagement.</p>

<p><i>Oliv.</i> [<i>Archly.</i>] Would you have done so, had
you been a man?</p>

<p><i>Vict.</i> Assuredly&mdash;knowing what I now do as a
woman.</p>

<p><i>Oliv.</i> But can all this be worth while, merely to
rival a fickle husband with one woman, whilst he is
setting his feather, perhaps, at half a score others?</p>

<p><i>Vict.</i> To rival him was not my first motive. The
Portuguese robbed me of his heart; I concluded she
had fascinations which nature had denied to me; it
was impossible to visit her as a woman; I, therefore,
assumed the Cavalier, to study her, that I might, if
possible, be to my Carlos, all he found in her.</p>

<p><i>Oliv.</i> Pretty humble creature?</p>

<p><i>Vict.</i> In this adventure I learnt more than I expected;&mdash;my
(oh, cruel!) my husband has given this
woman an estate, almost all that his dissipations
had left us.</p>

<p><i>Oliv.</i> Indeed!</p>

<p><i>Vict.</i> To make him more culpable, it was my
estate; it was that fortune which my lavish love had
made his, without securing it to my children.</p>

<p><i>Oliv.</i> How could you be so improvident?</p>

<p><i>Vict.</i> Alas! I trusted him with my heart, with my
happiness, without restriction. Should I have shown
a greater solicitude for any thing, than for these?</p>

<p><i>Oliv.</i> The event proves that you should; but how
can you be thus passive in your sorrow? since I had
assumed the man, I'd make him feel a man's resentment
for such injuries.</p>

<p><i>Vict.</i> Oh, Olivia! what resentment can I show
to him I have vowed to honour, and whom, both
my duty and my heart compel me yet to love.</p>

<p><i>Oliv.</i> Why, really now, I think&mdash;positively, there's
no thinking about it; 'tis among the arcana of the
married life, I suppose.</p>

<p><i>Vict.</i> You, who know me, can judge how I suffered
in prosecuting my plan. I have thrown off the
delicacy of sex; I have worn the mask of love to the
destroyer of my peace&mdash;but the object is too great to
be abandoned&mdash;nothing less than to save my husband
from ruin, and to restore him, again a lover, to my
faithful bosom.</p>

<p><i>Oliv.</i> Well, I confess, Victoria, I hardly know
whether most to blame or praise you; but, with the
rest of the world, I suppose, your success will determine
me.</p>

<p><i>Gasp.</i> Pray, madam, are your wedding shoes
ready? [<i>To</i> <span class="smallcaps">Olivia</span>.]</p>

<p><i>Oliv.</i> Insolence!<span class="nowrap">&mdash;&mdash;</span>I can scarcely ever keep up
the vixen to this fellow. [<i>Apart to</i> <span class="smallcaps">Victoria</span>.]</p>

<p><i>Gasp.</i> You'll want them, ma'am, to-morrow morning,
that's all&mdash;so I came to prepare ye.</p>

<p><i>Oliv.</i> I want wedding shoes to-morrow! if you
are kept on water gruel till I marry, that plump face
of yours will be chap-fallen, I believe.</p>

<p><i>Gasp.</i> Yes, truly, I believe so too. Lackaday,
did you suppose I came to bring you news of your
own wedding? no such glad tidings for you, lady, believe
me.&mdash;You married! I am sure the man who
ties himself to you, ought to be half a salamander,
and able to live in fire.</p>

<p><i>Oliv.</i> What marriage, then, is it, you do me the
honour to inform me of?</p>

<p><i>Gasp.</i> Why, your father's marriage. You'll have
a mother-in-law to-morrow, and having, like a dutiful
daughter, danced at the wedding, be immured in
a convent for life.</p>

<p><i>Oliv.</i> Immured in a convent! then I'll raise sedition
in the sisterhood, depose the abbess, and turn
the confessor's chair to a go-cart.</p>

<p><i>Gasp.</i> So, the threat of the mother-in-law, which
I thought would be worse than that of the abbess,
does not frighten ye?</p>

<p><i>Oliv.</i> No, because my father dares not give me one.&mdash;Marry,
without my consent! no, no, he'll never
think of it, depend on't; however, lest the fit should
grow strong upon him, I'll go and administer my
volatiles to keep it under.</p>
<p class="right">[<i>Exit</i> <span class="smallcaps">l. h.</span></p>

<p><i>Gasp.</i> Administer them cautiously then: too
strong a dose of your volatiles would make the fit
stubborn. Who'd think that pretty arch look belonged
to a termagant? what a pity! 'twould be
worth a thousand ducats to cure her.</p>

<p><i>Vict.</i> Has Inis told you I wanted to converse with
you in private, Gasper?</p>

<p><i>Gasp.</i> Oh, yes, madam, and I took particular notice,
that it was to be in private.<span class="nowrap">&mdash;&mdash;</span>Sure, says I,
Mrs. Inis, Madam Victoria has not taken a fancy to
me, and is going to break her mind.</p>

<p><i>Vict.</i> Whimsical! ha! ha! suppose I should, Gasper?</p>

<p><i>Gasp.</i> Why, then, madam, I should say, fortune
had used you devilish scurvily, to give you a gray-beard
in a livery. I know well enough, that some
young ladies have given themselves to gray-beards,
in a gilded coach, and others have run away with a
handsome youth in worsted lace; they each had
their apology; but if you run away with me&mdash;pardon
me, madam, I could not stand the ridicule.</p>

<p><i>Vict.</i> Oh, very well; but if you refuse to run away
with me, will you do me another favour?</p>

<p><i>Gasp.</i> Any thing you'll order, madam, except
dancing a fandango.</p>

<p><i>Vict.</i> You have seen my rich old uncle in the country?</p>

<p><i>Gasp.</i> What, Don Sancho, who, with two thirds
of a century in his face, affects the misdemeanors of
youth; hides his baldness with amber locks, and
complains of the tooth-ache, to make you believe,
that the two rows of ivory he carries in his head,
grew there?</p>

<p><i>Vict.</i> Oh, you know him, I find; could you assume
his character for an hour, and make love for him?
you know, it must be in the style of King Roderigo
the First.</p>

<p><i>Gasp.</i> Hang it! I am rather too near his own age;
to appear an old man with effect, one should not be
above twenty; 'tis always so on the stage.</p>

<p><i>Vict.</i> Pho! you might pass for Juan's grandson.</p>

<p><i>Gasp.</i> Nay, if your ladyship condesends to flatter
me, you have me.</p>

<p><i>Vict.</i> Then follow me; for Don C&aelig;sar, I hear, is
approaching&mdash;in the garden I'll make you acquainted
with my plan, and impress on your mind every
trait of my uncle's character. If you can hit him
off, the arts of Laura shall be foiled, and Carlos be
again Victoria's.</p>

<p><i>Oliv.</i> But it is not too late, and you shan't be resolved,
I say. Indeed, now, I'll be upon my guard
with the next Don&mdash;what's his name? not a trace of
the Xantippe left.&mdash;I'll study to be charming.</p>

charming enough, if you would but hold your tongue.</p>

<p><i>Oliv.</i> Do you think so? then to the next lover I
won't open my lips; I'll answer every thing he says
with a smile, and if he asks me to have him, drop a
courtesy of thankfulness.</p>

<p><i>C&aelig;sar.</i> Pshaw! that's too much t'other way; you
are always either above the mark or below it; you
must talk, but talk with good humour. Can't you look
gently and prettily, now, as I do? and say, yes, sir,
and no, sir; and 'tis very fine weather, sir; and pray,
sir, were you at the ball last night? and, I caught a
sad cold the other evening; and bless me! I hear
Lucinda has run away with her footman, and Don
Philip has married his housemaid?&mdash;That's the way
agreeable ladies talk; you never hear any thing else.</p>

<p><i>Oliv.</i> Very true; and you shall see me as agreeable
as the best of them, if you won't give me a mother-in-law
to snub me, and set me tasks, and to take
up all the fine apartments, and send up poor little
Livy to lodge next the stars.</p>

<p><i>C&aelig;sar.</i> Ha! if thou wert but always thus soft and
good-humoured, no mother-in-law in Spain, though
she brought the Castiles for her portion, should have
power to snub thee. But, Livy, the trial's at hand,
for at this moment do I expect Don Vincentio to visit
you. He is but just returned from England, and,
probably, has yet heard only of your beauty and fortune;
I hope it is not from you he will learn the
other part of your character.</p>

<p><i>Oliv.</i> This moment expect him! two new lovers
in a day?</p>

<p><i>C&aelig;sar.</i> Beginning already, as I hope to live! ay,
I see 'tis in vain; I'll send him an excuse, and marry
Marcella before night.</p>

<p><i>Vin.</i> Presto, presto, signior! where is the Olivia?&mdash;not
a moment to spare. I left off in all the fury
of composition; minums and crotchets have been
battling it through my head the whole day, and trying
a semibreve in G sharp, has made me as flat as
double F.</p>

<p><i>C&aelig;sar.</i> Sharp and flat!&mdash;trying a semibreve!&mdash;oh&mdash;gad,
sir! I had like not to have understood you;
but a semibreve is something of a demi-culverin, I
take it; and you have been practising the art military.</p>

<p><i>Vin.</i> Art military!&mdash;what, sir! are you unacquainted
with music?</p>

<p><i>C&aelig;sar.</i> Music! oh, I ask pardon: then you are
fond of music<span class="nowrap">&mdash;&mdash;</span>'ware of discords! [<i>Aside.</i>]</p>

<p><i>Vin.</i> Fond of it! devoted to it.&mdash;I composed a
thing to-day, in all the gusto of Sacchini, and the
sweetness of Gluck. But this recreant finger fails me
in composing a passage in E octave; if it does not
gain more elastic vigour in a week, I shall be tempted
to have it amputated, and supply the shake with a
spring.</p>

<p><i>C&aelig;sar.</i> Mercy! amputate a finger, to supply a
shake!</p>

<p><i>Vin.</i> Oh, that's a trifle in the road to reputation&mdash;to
be talked of, is the summum bonum of this life.&mdash;A
young man of rank should not glide through the
world, without a distinguished rage, or, as they call
it in England&mdash;a hobby-horse.</p>

<p><i>C&aelig;sar.</i> A hobby horse!</p>

<p><i>Vin.</i> Yes; that is, every man of figure determines
on setting out in life, in that land of liberty, in what
line to ruin himself; and that choice is called his hobby-horse.
One makes the turf his scene of action&mdash;another
drives about tall phaetons, to peep into their
neighbour's garret windows; and a third rides his
hobby-horse in parliament, where it jerks him sometimes
on one side, and sometimes on the other; sometimes
in, and sometimes out; till at length, he is jerked
out of his honesty, and his constituents out of their
freedom.</p>

<p><i>C&aelig;sar.</i> Ay! Well, 'tis a wonder, that with such
sort of hobby-horses as these, they should still outride
all the world, to the goal of glory.</p>

<p><i>Vin.</i> This is all cantabile; nothing to do with the
subject of the piece, which is Donna Olivia;&mdash;pray
give me the key note to her heart.</p>

<p><i>C&aelig;sar.</i> Upon my word, signor, to speak in your

sounded.&mdash;Ah! here she comes! look at her.&mdash;Isn't
she a fine girl?</p>

<p><i>C&aelig;sar.</i> O, such perverse obedience!</p>

<p><i>Vin.</i> Really, madam, I have not the honour to
know Don Philip and Lucinda&mdash;nor am I happy
enough, entirely to comprehend you.</p>

<p><i>Oliv.</i> No! I only meant to be agreeable&mdash;but, perhaps,
you have no taste for pretty little small talk!</p>

<p><i>Vin.</i> Pretty little small talk!</p>

<p><i>Oliv.</i> A marked character you admire; so do I, I
dote on it.&mdash;I would not resemble the rest of the
world in any thing.</p>

<p><i>Vin.</i> My taste to the fiftieth part of a crotchet!&mdash;We

<p><i>Oliv.</i> And that will be unlike the rest of the world,
and therefore, charming!</p>

<p><i>C&aelig;sar.</i> [<i>Aside.</i>] It will do! I have hit her humour
at last. Why didn't this young dog offer himself before?</p>

<p><i>Oliv.</i> I believe, I have the honour to carry my
taste that way, farther than you, Don Vincentio.
Pray, now, what is your usual style in living?</p>

<p><i>Vin.</i> My winters I spend in Madrid, as other people
do. My summers I drawl through at my castle<span class="nowrap">&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p><i>Oliv.</i> As other people do!&mdash;and yet you pretend
to taste and singularity, ha! ha! ha! Good Don Vincentio,
never talk of a marked character again. Go
into the country in July, to smell roses and woodbines,
when every body regales on their fragrance! Now, I
would rusticate only in winter, and my bleak castle
should be decorated with verdure and flowers, amidst
the soft zephyrs of December.</p>

<p><i>C&aelig;sar.</i> [<i>Aside.</i>] Oh, she'll go too far!</p>

<p><i>Oliv.</i> On the leafless trees I would hang green
branches&mdash;the labour of silk worms, and therefore,
natural; whilst my rose shrubs and myrtles should be
scented by the first perfumers in Italy. Unnatural,
indeed, but, therefore, singular and striking.</p>

<p><i>Vin.</i> Oh, charming! You beat me, where I thought
myself the strongest. Would they but establish
newspapers here, to paragraph our singularities, we
should be the most envied couple in Spain!</p>

<p><i>C&aelig;sar.</i> [<i>Aside.</i>] By St. Antony, he is as mad as
she is!</p>

<p><i>Vin.</i> What say you, Don C&aelig;sar? Olivia, and her
winter garden, and I and my music.</p>

<p><i>Oliv.</i> Music, did you say? Music! I am passionately
fond of that!</p>

<p><i>C&aelig;sar.</i> She has saved my life! I thought she was
going to knock down his hobby-horse. [<i>Aside.</i>]</p>

<p><i>Vin.</i> You enchant me! I have the finest band in Madrid&mdash;My
first violin draws a longer bow than Giardini;
my clarionets, my viol de gamba<span class="nowrap">&mdash;&mdash;</span>Oh, you
shall have such concerts!</p>

<p><i>Oliv.</i> Concerts! Pardon me there&mdash;My passion is
a single instrument.</p>

<p><i>Vin.</i> That's carrying singularity very far indeed!
I love a crash; so does every body of taste.</p>

<p><i>Oliv.</i> But my taste isn't like every body's; my
nerves are so particularly fine, that more than one
instrument overpowers them.</p>

<p><i>Vin.</i> Pray tell me the name of that one: I am sure
it must be the most elegant and captivating in the
world.&mdash;I am impatient to know it.&mdash;We'll have no
other instrument in Spain, and I will study to become
its master, that I may woo you with its music.
Charming Olivia! tell me, is it a harpsichord? a piano
forte? a pentachord? a harp?</p>

<p><i>Oliv.</i> You have it, you have it; a harp&mdash;yes, a
Jew's-harp is, to me, the only instrument. Are you
not charmed with the delightful h&mdash;u&mdash;m of its base,
running on the ear, like the distant rumble of a state
coach? It presents the idea of vastness and importance
to the mind. The moment you are its master&mdash;I'll
give you my hand.</p>

<p><i>Vin.</i> Da capo, madam, da capo! a Jew's-harp!</p>

<p><i>Oliv.</i> Bless me, sir, don't I tell you so? Violins
chill me; clarionets, by sympathy, hurt my lungs;
and, instead of maintaining a band under my roof, I
would not keep a servant, who knew a bassoon from
a flute, or could tell whether he heard a jigg, or a
canzonetta.</p>

<p><i>C&aelig;sar.</i> Oh thou perverse one! you know you love
concerts&mdash;you know you do. [<i>In great agitation.</i>]</p>

<p><i>Oliv.</i> I detest them! It's vulgar custom that attaches
people to the sound of fifty different instruments
at once; 'twould be as well to talk on the same
subject, in fifty different tongues. A band; 'tis a
mere olio of sound! I'd rather listen to a three-stringed
guitar serenading a sempstress in some neighbouring
garret.</p>

<p><i>C&aelig;sar.</i> Oh you<span class="nowrap">&mdash;&mdash;</span>Don Vincentio, [<i>Crosses</i>, <span class="smallcaps">c.</span>]
this is nothing but perverseness, wicked perverseness.
Hussy!&mdash;didn't you shake, when you mentioned a
garret? didn't bread and water, and a step-mother,
come into your head at the same time?</p>

<p><i>Vin.</i> Piano, piano, good sir! Spare yourself all
farther trouble. Should the Princess of Guzzarat,
and all her diamond mines, offer themselves, I would
not accept them, in lieu of my band&mdash;a band, that
has half ruined me to collect. I would have allowed
Donna Olivia a blooming garden in winter; I
would even have procured barrenness and snow for
her in the dog-days; but, to have my band insulted!&mdash;to
have my knowledge in music slighted!&mdash;to be
roused from all the energies of composition, by the
drone of a Jew's-harp, I cannot breathe under the idea.</p>

<p><i>C&aelig;sar.</i> Then&mdash;then you refuse her, sir!</p>

<p><i>Vin.</i> I cannot use so harsh a word&mdash;I take my
leave of the lady.&mdash;Adieu, madam&mdash;I leave you to

crash.</p>

whom I have been fool enough, to dream and think
of these two years, and I don't know that ever he
thought of me in his life.</p>

<p><i>Vict.</i> Two years discovering that?</p>

<p><i>Oliv.</i> He has been abroad. The only time I ever
saw him was at the Duchess of Medina's&mdash;there
were a thousand people; and he was so elegant, so
careless, so handsome!&mdash;In a word, though he set
off for France the next morning, by some witchcraft
or other, he has been before my eyes ever since.</p>

<p><i>Vict.</i> Was the impression mutual?</p>

<p><i>Oliv.</i> He hardly noticed me. I was then a bashful
thing just out of a convent, and shrunk from
observation.</p>

<p><i>Vict.</i> Why, I thought you were going to meet
him.</p>

<p><i>Oliv.</i> To be sure; I sent him a command this
morning, to be at the Prado. I am determined to
find out if his heart is engaged, and if it is<span class="nowrap">&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p><i>Vict.</i> You'll cross your arms, and crown your
brow with willows?</p>

<p><i>Oliv.</i> No, positively; not whilst we have myrtles.
I would prefer Julio, 'tis true, to all his sex; but if
he is stupid enough to be insensible to me, I shan't
for that reason, pine like a girl, on chalk and oatmeal.&mdash;No,
no; in that case, I shall form a new
plan, and treat my future lovers with more civility.</p>

<p><i>Vict.</i> You are the only woman in love, I ever
heard talk reasonably.</p>

<p><i>Oliv.</i> Well, prepare for the Prado, and I'll give
you a lesson against your days of widowhood.
Don't you wish this the moment, Victoria? A pretty
widow at four-and-twenty has more subjects, and
a wider empire, than the first monarch upon earth.
I long to see you in your weeds.</p>

<p><i>Vict.</i> Never may you see them! Oh, Olivia! my
happiness, my life, depend on my husband. The
fond hope of still being united to him, gives me
spirits in my affliction, and enables me to support
even the period of his neglect with patience.</p>

<p class="noindent">Don Garcia, never make love to a woman in a
veil.</p>

<p><i>Gar.</i> Why so, pr'ythee? Veils and secrecy are the
chief ingredients in a Spanish amour; but in two
years, Julio, thou art grown absolutely French.</p>

<p><i>Julio.</i> That may be; but if ever I trust to a veil
again, may no lovely, blooming beauty ever trust
me. Why dost know, I have been an hour at the
feet of a creature, whose first birth-day must have
been kept the latter end of the last century, and
whose trembling, weak voice, I mistook for the timid
cadence of bashful fifteen!</p>

<p><i>Gar.</i> Ha! ha! ha! What a happiness to have seen
thee in thy raptures, petitioning for half a glance
only, of the charms the envious veil concealed!</p>

<p><i>Julio.</i> Yes; and when she unveiled her Gothic
countenance, to render the thing completely ridiculous,
she began moralizing; and positively would
not let me out of the snare, till I had persuaded her
she had worked a conversion, and that I'd never
make love&mdash;but in an honest way, again.</p>

<p><i>Gar.</i> Oh, that honest way of love-making is delightful,
to be sure! I had a dose of it this morning;
but, happily, the ladies have not yet learned to veil
their tempers, though they have their faces.</p>

<p><i>Vin.</i> Julio! Garcia! congratulate me!&mdash;Such an
escape! [<i>Crosses to</i> <span class="smallcaps">c.</span>]</p>

<p><i>Julio.</i> What have you escaped?</p>

<p><i>Vin.</i> Matrimony.</p>

<p><i>Gar.</i> Nay, then our congratulations may be mutual.
I have had a matrimonial escape too, this very
day. I was almost on the brink of the ceremony
with the veriest Xantippe!</p>

<p><i>Vin.</i> Oh, that was not my case&mdash;mine was a
sweet creature, all elegance, all life.</p>

<p><i>Julio.</i> Then where's the cause of congratulation?</p>

<p><i>Vin.</i> Cause! why she's ignorant of music! prefers
a jig to a canzonetta, and a Jew's-harp to a pentachord.</p>

<p><i>Gar.</i> Had my nymph no other fault, I would pardon
that, for she was lovely and rich.</p>

<p><i>Vin.</i> Mine, too, was lovely and rich; and, I'll be
sworn, as ignorant of scolding, as of the gamba!&mdash;but
not to know music!</p>

<p><i>Julio.</i> Gentle, lovely, and rich! and ignorant only
of music?</p>

<p><i>Gar.</i> A venial crime indeed! if the sweet creature
will marry me, she shall carry a Jew's-harp always
in her train, as a Scotch laird does his bagpipes. I
wish you'd give me your interest.</p>

<p><i>Vin.</i> Oh, most willingly, if thou hast so gross an
inclination; I'll name thee as a dull-souled, largo
fellow, to her father, Don C&aelig;sar.</p>

<p><i>Gar.</i> C&aelig;sar! what Don C&aelig;sar?</p>

<p><i>Vin.</i> De Zuniga.</p>

<p><i>Gar.</i> Impossible!</p>

<p><i>Vin.</i> Oh, I'll answer for her mother. So much
is Don Zuniga, her father, that he does not know
a semibreve from a culverin!</p>

<p><i>Gar.</i> The name of the lady?</p>

<p><i>Vin.</i> Olivia.</p>

<p><i>Gar.</i> Why you must be mad&mdash;that's my termagant!</p>

<p><i>Vin.</i> Termagant!&mdash;ha! ha! ha! Thou hast certainly
some vixen of a mistress, who infects thy ears
towards the whole sex. Olivia is timid and elegant.</p>

<p><i>Gar.</i> By Juno, there never existed such a scold!</p>

<p><i>Vin.</i> By Orpheus, there never was a gayer tempered
creature!&mdash;Spirit enough to be charming,
that's all. If she loved harmony, I'd marry her to-morrow.</p>

<p><i>Julio.</i> Ha! ha! what a ridiculous jangle! 'Tis
evident you speak of two different women.</p>

<p><i>Gar.</i> I speak of Donna Olivia, heiress to Don
C&aelig;sar de Zuniga.</p>

<p><i>Vin.</i> I speak of the heiress of Don C&aelig;sar de Zuniga,
who is called Donna Olivia.</p>

<p><i>Gar.</i> Sir, I perceive you mean to insult me.</p>

<p><i>Vin.</i> Your perceptions are very rapid, sir, but if
you choose to think so, I'll settle that point with you
immediately: But for fear of consequences, I'll fly
home, and add the last bar to my concerto, and then
meet you where you please. [<i>Crosses</i>, <span class="smallcaps">l.</span>]</p>

<p><i>Julio.</i> Pho! this is evidently misapprehension.
[<i>Crosses</i>, <span class="smallcaps">c.</span>] To clear the matter up, I'll visit the
lady, if you'll introduce me, Vincentio;&mdash;but you
shall both promise to be governed in this dispute, by
my decision.</p>

<p><i>Vin.</i> I'll introduce you with joy, if you'll try to
persuade her of the necessity of music, and the
charms of harmony.</p>

<p><i>Gar.</i> Yes, she needs that<span class="nowrap">&mdash;&mdash;</span>You'll find her all
jar and discord.</p>

<p><i>Julio.</i> Come, no more, Garcia; thou art but a
sort of male vixen thyself. Melodious Vincentio,
when shall I expect you?</p>

<p><i>Vin.</i> This evening.</p>

<p><i>Julio.</i> Not this evening; I have engaged to meet
a goldfinch in a grove&mdash;then I shall have music, you
rogue!</p>

<p><i>Vin.</i> It won't sing at night.</p>

<p><i>Julio.</i> Then I'll talk to it till the morning, and
hear it pour out its matins to the rising sun. Call
on me to-morrow; I'll then attend you to Donna
Olivia, and declare faithfully the impression her
character makes on me.&mdash;Come, Garcia, I must not
leave you together, lest his crotchets and your minums
should fall into a crash of discords.</p>

to get rid of my troubles.&mdash;Where are my troubles

<p><i>Oliv.</i> Why, really, now I see the man, I don't

He is moving towards us.</p>

<p><i>Vict.</i> I cannot speak to him, and yet my soul flies
to meet him.</p>

<p><i>Car.</i> Pray, lady, what occasioned that pretty
scream? I shrewdly suspect it was a trap.</p>

<p><i>Oliv.</i> A trap! ha! ha! ha!&mdash;a trap for you!</p>

<p><i>Car.</i> Why not, madam? Zounds, a man near six
feet high, and three flasks of burgundy in his head,
is worth laying a trap for.</p>

<p><i>Oliv.</i> Yes, unless he happens to be trapped before.
'Tis about two years since you was caught, I take it&mdash;do
keep farther off!&mdash;Odious! a married man!</p>

<p><i>Car.</i> The devil! is it posted under every saint in
the street, that I am a married man?</p>

<p><i>Oliv.</i> No, you carry the marks about you; that
rueful phiz could never belong to a bachelor. Besides,
there's an odd appearance on your temples&mdash;does
your hat sit easily?</p>

the thorns of matrimony? Bless us! had you but
looked about you a little, what a market might have
been made of that fine, proper, promising person of
yours.</p>

<p><i>Car.</i> Confound thee, confound thee! If thou art a

and thou never be able to give him cause for
them; and if thou art a maid, may'st thou be an old

<p><i>Vict.</i> I demand a price, that, perhaps, you cannot
give&mdash;I ask unbounded love; but you have a wife.</p>

<p><i>Car.</i> And, therefore, the readier to love every
other woman; 'tis in your favour, child.</p>

<p><i>Car.</i> Ever! yes, ever; till we find each other
dull company, and yawn, and talk of our neighbours

can. Do you accede to the demand?</p>

could draw your picture.</p>

<p><i>Julio.</i> Imprimis, a broad high forehead, rounded
at the top, like an old-fashioned gateway.</p>

<p><i>Oliv.</i> Oh, horrid!</p>

<p><i>Julio.</i> Little gray eyes, a sharp nose, and hair, the
colour of rusty prunella.</p>

for your malicious libel.</p>

<p><i>Julio.</i> Say, rather, in adoration. What a charming
creature!</p>

<p><i>Oliv.</i> So, now for lies on the other side.</p>

<p><i>Julio.</i> A forehead formed by the graces; hair,
which cupid would steal for his bow-strings, were
he not engaged in shooting through those sparkling
hazel circlets, which nature has given you for eyes;
lips! that 'twere a sin to call so; they are fresh gathered
rose leaves, with the fragrant morning dew
still hanging on their rounded surface.</p>

<p><i>Oliv.</i> Is that extemporaneous, or ready cut, for
every woman who takes off her veil to you?</p>

<p><i>Julio.</i> I believe, 'tis not extemporaneous; for Nature,
when she finished you, formed the sentiment in
my heart, and there it has been hid, till you, for
whom it was formed, called it into words.</p>

<p><i>Oliv.</i> Suppose I should understand, from all this,
that you have a mind to be in love with me; would
not you be finely caught?</p>

<p><i>Julio.</i> Charmingly caught! if you'll let me understand,
at the same time, that you have a mind to be
in love with me.</p>

<p><i>Oliv.</i> In love with a man! Heavens! I never loved
any thing but a squirrel!</p>

<p><i>Julio.</i> Make me your squirrel&mdash;I'll put on your
chain, and gambol and play for ever at your side.</p>

<p><i>Oliv.</i> But suppose you should have a mind to
break the chain?</p>

<p><i>Julio.</i> Then loosen it; for, if once that humour
seizes me, restraint won't cure it. Let me spring
and bound at liberty, and when I return to my lovely
mistress, tired of all but her, fasten me again to
your girdle, and kiss me while you chide.</p>

<p><i>Oliv.</i> Your servant&mdash;to encourage you to leave
me again?</p>

<p><i>Julio.</i> No; to make returning to you, the strongest
attraction to my life. Why are you silent?</p>

<p><i>Oliv.</i> I am debating, whether to be pleased or
displeased, at what you have said.</p>

<p><i>Julio.</i> Well?</p>

My friend and yours are approaching this way, and
they must not be interrupted.</p>

off as you please.</p>

he kiss my name? did he press the billet to his bosom

<p><i>Ped.</i> No, he didn't warm in that way; but he did
another, for he put it into the fire.</p>

<p><i>Laura.</i> How!</p>

<p><i>Ped.</i> Yes, when I spoke, he started, for, I think,

Don Florio; I thought she had been in this apartment. </p>

<p><i>Vict.</i> Now must I, with a mind torn by anxieties,
once more assume the lover of my husband's
mistress&mdash;of the woman, who has robbed me of his
heart, and his children of their fortune. Sure, my
task is hard. Oh, love! Oh, married love, assist
me! If I can, by any art, obtain from her that fatal
deed, I shall save my little ones from ruin, and then&mdash;But
I hear her step. [<i>Agitated, pressing her hand
on her bosom.</i>]&mdash;There! I have hid my griefs within
my heart, and, now for all the impudence of an
accomplished cavalier! [<i>Sings an air, sets her hat
in the glass, dances a few steps, &amp;c. then runs to</i>
<span class="smallcaps">Laura, r.</span>, <i>and seizes her hand.</i>] My lovely Laura!</p>

<p><i>Laura.</i> That look speaks Laura loved, as well
as lovely.</p>

<p><i>Vict.</i> To be sure! Petrarch immortalized his
Laura by his verses, and mine shall be immortal in
my passion.</p>

<p><i>Laura.</i> Oh, Florio, how deceitful! I know not
what enchantment binds me to thee.</p>

<p><i>Vict.</i> Me! my dear! is all this to me?</p>

<p class="right">[<i>Playing carelessly with the feather in her hat.</i></p>

<p><i>Laura.</i> Yes, ingrate, thee!</p>

<p><i>Vict.</i> Positively, Laura, you have these extravagancies
so often, I wonder my passion can stand
them. To be plain, those violences in your temper
may make a pretty relief in the flat of matrimony,
child, but they do not suit that state of freedom
which is necessary to my happiness. It was by
such destructive arts as these you cured Don Carlos
of his love.</p>

<p><i>Laura.</i> Cured Don Carlos! Oh, Florio! wert
thou but as he is?</p>

<p><i>Vict.</i> Why, you don't pretend he loves you still?  [<i>Eagerly.</i>]</p>

<p><i>Laura.</i> Yes, most ardently and truly.</p>

<p><i>Vict.</i> Hah!</p>

<p><i>Laura.</i> If thou wouldst persuade me that thy passion
is real, borrow his words, his looks: be a hypocrite
one dear moment, and speak to me in all the
frenzy of that love which warms the heart of
Carlos!</p>

<p><i>Vict.</i> The heart of Carlos!</p>

<p><i>Laura.</i> Hah, that seemed a jealous pang&mdash;it gives
my hopes new life. [<i>Aside.</i>] Yes, Florio, he, indeed,
knows what it is to love. For me he forsook a
beauteous wife; nay, and with me he would forsake
his country.</p>

<p><i>Vict.</i> Villain! Villain!</p>

<p><i>Laura.</i> Nay, let not the thought distress you thus&mdash;Carlos
I despise&mdash;he is the weakest of mankind.</p>

<p><i>Vict.</i> 'Tis false, madam, you cannot despise him.
Carlos the weakest of mankind! Heavens! what
woman could resist him? Persuasion sits on his
tongue, and love, almighty love, triumphant in his
eyes!</p>

<p><i>Laura.</i> This is strange; you speak of your rival
with the admiration of a mistress.</p>

<p><i>Vict.</i> Laura! it is the fate of jealousy as well as
love, to see the charms of its object, increased and
heightened. I am jealous&mdash;jealous to distraction,
of Don Carlos; and cannot taste peace, unless you'll
swear never to see him more.</p>

<p><i>Laura.</i> I swear, joyfully swear, never to behold
or speak to him again. When, dear youth, shall
we retire to Portugal?&mdash;We are not safe here.</p>

<p><i>Vict.</i> You know I am not rich.&mdash;You must first
sell the lands my rival gave you.</p>
<p class="right">[<i>Observing her with apprehension.</i></p>

<p><i>Laura.</i> 'Tis done&mdash;I have found a purchaser, and
to-morrow the transfer will be finished.</p>

<p><i>Vict.</i> [<i>Aside.</i>] Ah! I have now, then, nothing to
trust to but the ingenuity of Gasper. There is reason
to fear Don Carlos had no right in that estate,
with which you supposed yourself endowed.</p>

<p><i>Laura.</i> No right! what could have given you
those suspicions?</p>

<p><i>Vict.</i> A conversation with Juan, his steward, who
assures me his master never had an estate in Leon.</p>

<p><i>Laura.</i> Never! what, not by marriage?</p>

<p><i>Vict.</i> Juan says so.</p>

<p><i>Laura.</i> My blood runs cold; can I have taken
pains to deceive myself?&mdash;Could I think so, I
should be mad!</p>

<p><i>Vict.</i> These doubts may soon be annihilated, or
confirmed to certainty.&mdash;I have seen Don Sancho,
the uncle of Victoria; he is now in Madrid.&mdash;You
have told me that he once professed a passion for
you.</p>

<p><i>Laura.</i> Oh, to excess; but at that time I had another
object.</p>

<p><i>Vict.</i> Have you conversed with him much?</p>

<p><i>Laura.</i> I never saw him nearer than from my
balcony, where he used to ogle me through a glass,
suspended by a ribbon, like an order of knighthood;
he is weak enough to fancy it gives him an air of distinction&mdash;Ha!
ha! But where can I find him? I
must see him.</p>

<p><i>Vict.</i> Write him a billet, and I will send it to his
lodgings.</p>

<p><i>Laura.</i> Instantly&mdash;Dear Florio, a new prospect
opens to me&mdash;Don Sancho is rich and generous;
and, by playing on his passions, his fortune may be
a constant fund to us.&mdash;I'll dip my pen in flattery.</p>
<p class="right">[<i>Exit</i>, <span class="smallcaps">r.</span></p>

<p><i>Vict.</i> Base woman! how can I pity thee, or regret
the steps which my duty obliges me to take?
For myself, I would not swerve from the nicest
line of rectitude, nor wear the shadow of deceit.
But, for my children!&mdash;Is there a parental heart

charming intelligence of which thou art so full this
morning?</p>

<p><i>Min.</i> Why, ma'am, as I was in the balcony that
overlooks Don Vasquez's garden, Donna Marcella
told me, that Don C&aelig;sar had last night been to pay
her a visit previous to their marriage, and&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Oliv.</i> Their marriage! How can you give me the
intelligence with such a look of joy? Their marriage!&mdash;what
will become of me?</p>

<p><i>Min.</i> Dear ma'am! if you'll but have patience.&mdash;She
says that, Don C&aelig;sar and she are perfectly
agreed&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Oliv.</i> Still with that smirking face?&mdash;I can't have
patience.</p>

<p><i>Min.</i> Then, madam, if you won't let me tell the
story, please to read it<span class="nowrap">&mdash;&mdash;</span>Here's a letter from
Donna Marcella.</p>

<p><i>Oliv.</i> Why did you not give it me at first? [<i>Reads.</i>]</p>

<p><i>Min.</i> Because I didn't like to be cut out of my
story. If orators were obliged to come to the point
at once, mercy on us! what tropes and figures
we should lose!</p>

<p><i>Oliv.</i> Oh, Minette! I give you leave to smirk
again&mdash;listen. [<i>Reads.</i>] <i>I am more terrified at the
idea of becoming your father's wife, than you are in
expectation of a stepmother; and Don C&aelig;sar would
be as loath as either of us.&mdash;He only means to frighten
you into matrimony, and I have, on certain conditions,
agreed to assist him; but, whatever you may
hear, or see, be assured that nothing is so impossible,
as that he should become the husband of Donna
Marcella.</i>&mdash;Oh, delightful girl! how I love her for
this!</p>

<p><i>Min.</i> Yes, ma'am; and if you'd had patience, I
should have told you that she's now here with Don
C&aelig;sar, in grave debate how to begin the attack;
which must force you to take shelter in the arms of
a husband.</p>

<p><i>Oliv.</i> Ah, no matter how they begin it. Let
them amuse themselves in raising batteries; my reserved
fire shall tumble them about their ears, in
the moment my poor father is singing his Io's for
victory.&mdash;But here come the lovers&mdash;Well, I protest
now, sixteen and sixty is a very comely sight.&mdash;'Tis

Olivia, here's Donna Marcella come to visit you&mdash;though,
as matters are, that respect is due from you.</p>

<p><i>Oliv.</i> I am sensible of the condescension. My dear
ma'am, how very good this is! [<i>Taking her hand.</i>]</p>

<p><i>C&aelig;sar.</i> Yes, you'll think yourself wonderfully
obliged, when you know all! [<i>Aside.</i>] Pray, Donna
Marcella, what do you think of these apartments?&mdash;The
furniture and decorations are my daughter's

do! You can't hide it.&mdash;You are frightened out of
your wits at the thoughts of a mother-in-law; especially
a young, gay, handsome one.</p>

<p><i>Oliv.</i> Pardon me, sir; the thought of a mother-in-law
was indeed disagreeable; but her being
young and gay qualifies it.<span class="nowrap">&mdash;&mdash;</span>I hope, ma'am,
you'll give us balls, and the most spirited parties.
[<i>Crosses</i>, <span class="smallcaps">c.</span>] You can't think how stupid we have

hope now&mdash;</p>

all this? Why, hussy, don't you know you'll have
no apartment but the garret?</p>

mending my health. 'Tis charming to sleep in an
elevated situation.</p>

<p><i>C&aelig;sar.</i> Here! here's an obstinate perverse slut!</p>

<p><i>Oliv.</i> Bless me, sir, are you angry that I look

has a bad effect on the temper.&mdash;I wish, my dear
papa, you had felt the influence of Donna Marcella's
charms somewhat sooner.</p>

<p><i>C&aelig;sar.</i> You do! you do! why this must be all
put on.&mdash;This can't be real.</p>

<p><i>Oliv.</i> Indeed, indeed it is; and I protest, your engagement
with this lady has given me more pleasure
than I have tasted ever since you began to tease
me about a husband. You seem determined to
have a marriage in the family; and I hope, now, I
shall live in quiet, with my dear, sweet, young mother-in-law.</p>

<p><i>C&aelig;sar.</i> Oh! oh! [<i>Walking about.</i>] Was there
ever&mdash;[<i>Crosses</i>, <span class="smallcaps">c.</span>] She doesn't care for a mother-in-law!&mdash;Can't
frighten her!</p>

<p><i>Oliv.</i> Sure, my fate is very peculiar; that being
pleased with your choice, and submitting, with
humble duty, to your will, should be the cause of
offence.</p>

<p><i>C&aelig;sar.</i> Hussy! I don't want you to be pleased

humble duty to my will.&mdash;Where I do want you to

you are fond of a<span class="nowrap">&mdash;&mdash;</span>'faith, I can hardly speak it,
[<i>Aside.</i>]&mdash;of a<span class="nowrap">&mdash;&mdash;</span>Jew's-harp. [<i>Smothering a laugh.</i>]</p>

<p><i>Min.</i> A Jew's-harp! Mercy! What, do you think
a person of my birth and figure, can have such fancies
as that?<span class="nowrap">&mdash;&mdash;</span>No, sir, I love fiddles, French horns,
tabors, and all the cheerful, noisy instruments in the
world.</p>

<p><i>Julio.</i> [<i>Aside.</i>] Vincentio must have been mad;
and I as mad as he, to mention it. Then you are
fond of concerts, madam?</p>

<p><i>Min.</i> Dote on them! I wish he'd offer me a ticket. [<i>Aside.</i>]</p>

<p><i>Julio.</i> [<i>Aside.</i>] Vincentio is clearly wrong.&mdash;Now
to prove how far the other was right, in supposing
her a vixen.</p>

<p><i>Min.</i> There is a grand public concert, sir, to be
to-morrow. Pray, do you go?</p>

<p><i>Julio.</i> I believe I shall have that pleasure, madam.</p>

<p><i>Min.</i> My father, Don C&aelig;sar, won't let me purchase
a ticket: I think it's very hard.</p>

<p><i>Julio.</i> Pardon me&mdash;I think it's perfectly right.</p>

<p><i>Min.</i> Right! what, to refuse me a trifling expense,
that would procure me a great pleasure?</p>

<p><i>Julio.</i> Yes, doubtless&mdash;the ladies are too fond of
pleasure: I think Don C&aelig;sar is exemplary.</p>

<p><i>Min.</i> Lord, sir! you'd think it very hard, if you
were me, to be locked up all your life; and know
nothing of the world but what you could catch
through the bars of your balcony.</p>

<p><i>Julio.</i> Perhaps I might; but, as a man, I am convinced
'tis right. Daughters and wives should be
equally excluded those destructive haunts of dissipation.
Let them keep to their embroidery, nor
ever presume to show their faces but at their own
firesides.<span class="nowrap">&mdash;&mdash;</span>This will bring out the Xantippe,
surely! [<i>Aside.</i>]</p>

<p><i>Min.</i> Well, sir, I don't know&mdash;to be sure, home,
as you say, is the fittest place for women. For my
part, I could live for ever at home. I am determined
he shall have his way; who knows what may happen? [<i>Aside.</i>]</p>

<p><i>Julio.</i> [<i>Aside.</i>] By all the powers of caprice, Garcia
is as wrong as the other!</p>

<p><i>Min.</i> I delight in nothing so much as in sitting by
my father, and hearing his tales of old times; and I
fancy, when I have a husband, I shall be more happy
to sit and listen to his stories of present times.</p>

<p><i>Julio.</i> Perhaps your husband, fair lady, might not
be inclined so to amuse you. Men have a thousand
delights that call them abroad; and probably your
chief amusements would be counting the hours of
his absence, and giving a tear to each as it passed.</p>

<p><i>Min.</i> Well, he should never see them, however.
I would always smile when he entered; and if he
found my eyes red, I'd say, I had been weeping over
the history of the unfortunate damsel, whose true
love hung himself at sea, and appeared to her after
wards in a wet jacket.&mdash;Sure, this will do! [<i>Aside.</i>]</p>

<p><i>Julio.</i> I am every moment more astonished. Pray,
madam, permit me a question. Are you, really&mdash;yet
I cannot doubt it&mdash;are you, really, Donna Olivia,
the daughter of Don C&aelig;sar, to whom Don Garcia
and Don Vincentio had lately the honour of paying
their addresses?</p>

<p><i>Min.</i> Am I Donna Olivia! ha! ha! ha! what a
question! Pray, sir, is this my father's house?&mdash;Are
you Don Julio?</p>

<p><i>Julio.</i> I beg your pardon; but, to confess, I had
heard you described as a lady who had not quite so
much sweetness, and<span class="nowrap">&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p><i>Min.</i> Oh! what, you had heard that I was a termagant,
I suppose.&mdash;'Tis all slander, sir: there is not
in Madrid, though I say it, a sweeter temper than my
own; and though I have refused a good many lovers,
yet, if one was to offer himself that I could like&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Julio.</i> You would take pity, and reward his passion.</p>

<p><i>Min.</i> I would.</p>

<p><i>Julio.</i> Lovely Donna Olivia, how charming is this
frankness!&mdash;'Tis a little odd, though! [<i>Aside.</i>]</p>

<p><i>Min.</i> Why, I believe I should take pity: for it always
seemed to me to be very hard-hearted, to be
cruel to a lover that one likes, because, in that case,
one should&mdash;a&mdash;you know, sir, the sooner the affair
is over, the better for both parties.</p>

<p><i>Julio.</i> What the deuce does she mean?&mdash;Is this
Garcia's sour fruit?</p>

<p><i>C&aelig;sar.</i> [<i>Without,</i> <span class="smallcaps">r.</span>] Olivia! Olivia!</p>

<p><i>Min.</i> Bless me, I hear my father! Now, sir, I
have a particular fancy that you should not tell him,
in this first visit, your design.</p>

<p><i>Julio.</i> Madam, my design!</p>

<p><i>Min.</i> Yes, that you will not speak out, till we have
had a little further conversation, which I'll take care
to give you an opportunity for very soon. He'll be
here in a moment: now, pray, Don Julio, go. If he
should meet you, and ask who you are, you can say,
that you are&mdash;you may say, that you came on a visit
to my maid, you know.</p>
<p class="right">[<i>Exit</i>, <span class="smallcaps">r.</span></p>

<p><i>Julio.</i> I thank you, madam, [<i>Aloud.</i>] for my dismission.

happy rival. Oh, my blade will hardly keep in its

<p><i>Laura.</i> Think no more of him&mdash;he has been long
banished my thoughts, be assured. I wonder you
gave your niece to him, with such a fortune.</p>

<p><i>Gasp.</i> Gave! she gave herself; and, as to fortune,
she had not a pistole from me.</p>

<p><i>Laura.</i> 'Twas, indeed, unnecessary, with so fine
an estate as she had in Leon.</p>

<p><i>Gasp.</i> My niece an estate in Leon! Not enough
to give shelter to a field-mouse; and if he has told
you so, he is a braggart.</p>

of the lands.</p>

<p><i>Gasp.</i> Nay, madam, don't be afraid! 'Tis my estate&mdash;that's
all; the very castle where I was born;
and which I never did, nor ever will, bestow on any
Don in the two Castiles. Dissembling rogue! Bribe
you with a fictitious title to my estate&mdash;ha! ha! ha!</p>

<p><i>Laura.</i> [<i>Aside.</i>] Curses follow him! The villain
I employed must have been his creature; his reluctance
all art; and, whilst I believed myself undoing
him, was duped myself!</p>

<p><i>Gasp.</i> Could you suppose I'd give Carlos such an
estate for running away with my niece? No, no;
the vineyards, and the cornfields, and the woods of
Rosalvo, are not for him.&mdash;I've somebody else in my
eye&mdash;in my eye, observe me&mdash;to give those to:&mdash;Can't
you guess who it is?</p>

awful duty; bow, Laura! bow before her <ins title="original has thorne">throne</ins>, and

Wing.</i>] a young girl and an old man&mdash;wife or daughter?
They are coming this way. My lovely incognita,
by all that's propitious! Why did not some kind
spirit whisper to me my happiness? but hold&mdash;she
can't mean to treat the old gentleman with a sight of
me.</p>

<p><i>C&aelig;sar.</i> No, no, madam, no going out&mdash;There,
madam, this is your apartment, your house, your
garden, your assembly, till you go to your convent.
Why, how impudent you are to look thus unconcerned!&mdash;Can
hardly forbear laughing in my face!&mdash;Very
well&mdash;very well!</p>
<p class="right">[<i>Exit, double locking the door</i>, <span class="smallcaps">l.</span></p>

<p><i>Oliv.</i> Ha! ha! ha! I'll be even with you, my dear
father, if you treble lock it. I'll stay here two days,
without once asking for my liberty, and you'll come
the third, with tears in your eyes, to take me out.&mdash;He
has forgot the door leading to the garden&mdash;but I
vow I'll stay. [<i>Sitting down.</i>] I can make the time
pass pleasantly enough.</p>

<p><i>Julio.</i> I hope so.</p>
<p class="right">[<i>Looking over the back of the sofa.</i></p>

<p><i>Oliv.</i> Heaven and earth!</p>

<p><i>Julio.</i> My dear creature, why are you so alarmed?
am I here before you expected me?</p>

<p class="right">[<i>Coming round</i>, <span class="smallcaps">r.</span></p>

<p><i>Oliv.</i> Expected you!</p>

<p><i>Julio.</i> Oh, this pretty surprise! Come, let us sit
down; I think your father was very obliging to lock
us in together.</p>

<p><i>Oliv.</i> Sir! sir! my father!</p>
<p class="right">[<i>Calling at the door.</i></p>

<p><i>C&aelig;sar.</i> [<i>Without.</i>] Ay, 'tis all in vain&mdash;I won't
come near you. There you are, and there you may
stay. I shan't return, make as much noise as you
will.</p>

<p><i>Julio.</i> Why, are you not ashamed that your father
has so much more consideration for your guest than
you have?</p>

<p><i>Oliv.</i> My guest! how is it possible he can have
discovered me? [<i>Aside.</i>]</p>

<p><i>Julio.</i> Pho! This is carrying the thing further than
you need&mdash;if there was a third person here, it might
be prudent.</p>

<p><i>Oliv.</i> Why, this assurance, Don Julio, is really&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Julio.</i> The thing in the world you are most ready
to pardon.</p>

<p><i>Oliv.</i> Upon my word, I don't know how to treat
you.</p>

<p><i>Julio.</i> Consult your heart!</p>

<p><i>Oliv.</i> I shall consult my honour.</p>

<p><i>Julio.</i> Honour is a pretty thing to play with, but
when spoken with that very grave face, after having
sent your maid to bring me here, is really more than
I expected. I shall be in an ill humour presently&mdash;I
won't stay if you treat me thus.</p>
<p class="right">[<i>Crosses</i>, <span class="smallcaps">l.</span></p>

<p><i>Oliv.</i> Well, this is superior to every thing! I have
heard that men will slander women privately to each
other; 'tis their common amusement; but to do it to
one's face!&mdash;and you really pretend that I sent for
you?</p>

<p><i>Julio.</i> Ha! ha! ha! Well, if it obliges you, I will
pretend that you did not send for me; that your maid
did not conduct me hither; nay, that I have not now
the supreme happiness&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Julio.</i> Donna Olivia de Zuniga! how the devil
came she here?</p>

<p><i>Oliv.</i> [<i>Aside.</i>] That's lucky! Olivia, my dear friend,
why do you run away? Keep the character I charge
you. [<i>Apart to</i> <span class="smallcaps">Minette</span>.] Be still Olivia.</p>

<p><i>Min.</i> Oh! dear madam! I was&mdash;I was so frightened
when I saw that gentleman.</p>

<p><i>Oliv.</i> Oh, my dear; it's the merriest pretty kind
of gentleman in the world; he pretends that I sent
my maid for him into the streets, ha! ha!</p>

<p><i>Julio.</i> That's right; always tell a thing yourself,
which you would not have believed.</p>

<p><i>Min.</i> It is the readiest excuse for being found in a
lady's apartment, however. Now will I swear I
know nothing of the matter.      [<i>Aside.</i>]</p>

<p><i>Oliv.</i> Now, I think it a horrid poor excuse; he has
certainly not had occasion to invent reasons for such
impertinencies often. Tell me that he has made
love to you to-day.      [<i>Apart.</i>]</p>

<p><i>Min.</i> I fancy that he has had occasion to excuse
impertinencies often;&mdash;his impertinence to me to-day<span class="nowrap">&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p><i>Julio.</i> To you, madam?</p>

<p><i>Min.</i> Making love to me, my dear, all the morning&mdash;could
hardly get him away, he was so desirous
to speak to my father. Nay, sir, I don't care for
your impatience.</p>

<p><i>Julio.</i> [<i>Aside.</i>] Now would I give a thousand pistoles
if she were a man!</p>

<p><i>Oliv.</i> Nay, then, this accidental meeting is fortunate&mdash;pray,
Don Julio, don't let my presence prevent
your saying what you think proper to my friend&mdash;shall
I leave you together? [<i>Crosses</i>, <span class="smallcaps">l.</span>]</p>

<p><i>Julio.</i> [<i>Apart.</i>] To contradict a lady on such an
assertion would be too gross; but, upon my honour,
Donna Olivia is the last woman upon earth who
could inspire me with a tender idea. Find an excuse
to send her away, my angel, I entreat you. I
have a thousand things to say, and the moments
are too precious to be given to her.</p>

<p><i>Oliv.</i> I think so too, but one can't be rude, you
know. Come, my dear, sit down, [<i>Seating herself</i>,
<span class="smallcaps">c.</span>] have you brought your work?</p>

<p><i>Min.</i> Yes, and they always keep me from his sight.</p>

<p><i>Julio.</i> Did ever one woman prevent another from

<p><i>C&aelig;sar.</i> What can be the meaning of all this? A
man in my daughter's apartment!</p>
<p class="right">[<i>Attempting to draw.</i></p>

<p><i>Gar.</i> Hold, sir! Don Julio is one of the first rank

your honour, without troubling your sword. We

<p><i>Julio.</i> [<i>To</i> <span class="smallcaps">Olivia</span>.] They have been cursedly

very civilly locked me in with your daughter.</p>

<p><i>C&aelig;sar.</i> Locked you in! why, then, did you not,
like a man of honour, cry out?</p>

<p><i>Julio.</i> The lady cried out, sir, and you told her
you would not return; but when Donna Olivia de
Zuniga entered, for whom I have conceived a most
violent passion<span class="nowrap">&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p><i>C&aelig;sar.</i> A passion for her! Oh, let me hear no
more on't.&mdash;A passion for her! You may as well
entertain a passion for the untameable hyena.</p>

<p><i>Gar.</i> There, Vincentio, what think you now?
Xantippe or not?</p>

<p><i>Vin.</i> I am afraid I must give up that&mdash;but pray
support me as to this point, Don C&aelig;sar; is not the
lady fond of a Jew's-harp?</p>

<p><i>C&aelig;sar.</i> Fond! she's fond of nothing, but playing
the vixen; there is not such a fury upon earth.</p>

<p><i>Julio.</i> These are odd liberties, with a person who
does not belong to him.</p>

<p><i>C&aelig;sar.</i> I'll play the hypocrite for her no more;
the world shall know her true character, they shall
know<span class="nowrap">&mdash;&mdash;</span>but ask her maid there.</p>

<p><i>Julio.</i> Her maid!</p>

<p><i>Min.</i> Why, yes, sir; to say truth, I am but Donna
Olivia's maid, after all.</p>

<p><i>Oliv.</i> [<i>Apart.</i>] Dear Minette! speak for me, or I
am now ruined.</p>

<p><i>Min.</i> I will, ma'am.&mdash;I must confess, sir, [<i>Going
up to</i> <span class="smallcaps">Julio</span>.] there never was so bitter a tempered
creature as my lady is. I have borne her humours
for two years; I have seen her by night and by day.
[<span class="smallcaps">Olivia</span> <i>pulls her sleeve, impatiently</i>.] I will, I will!
[<i>To</i> <span class="smallcaps">Olivia</span>.] and this I am sure, that if you marry
her, you'll rue the day every hour the first month,

I suppose, signor, we shall hear no more of your
passion; so let us go down, and leave madam to
begin her penance.</p>

<p><i>Julio.</i> My ideas are totally confused.&mdash;You Donna
Olivia de Zuniga, and the person I thought you, her
maid! something too flattering darts across my mind.</p>

<p><i>C&aelig;sar.</i> If you have taken a fancy to her maid, I
have nothing farther to say; but as to that violent
creature<span class="nowrap">&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p><i>Julio.</i> Oh, do not profane her. Where is that
spirit which you tell me of? Is it that which speaks
in modest, conscious blushes on her cheeks? Is it
that which bends her lovely eyes to earth?</p>

<p><i>C&aelig;sar.</i> Ay, she's only bending them to earth,
considering how to afflict me with some new obstinacy&mdash;she'll
break out like a tigress in a moment.</p>

<p><i>Julio.</i> It cannot be&mdash;are you, charming woman!

<p><i>Oliv.</i> Would you not fear to trust your fate with

<p><i>Julio.</i> No, I'd bless the hour that bound my fate

what do you think of a crash?</p>

thus, since morning?</p>

<p><i>Car.</i> A wife! Marry, Julio, marry!</p>

<p><i>Julio.</i> What! this advice from you?</p>

<p><i>Car.</i> Yes; and when you have married an angel,
when that angel has done for you such things, as
makes your gratitude almost equal to your love, you
may then guess something of what I feel, in calling
this angel mine.</p>

<p><i>Oliv.</i> Now, I trust, Don Julio, after all this, that

<p><i>Vict.</i> Hold, Olivia! it is not necessary that a husband
should be faulty, to make a wife's character exemplary.&mdash;Should
he be tenderly watchful of your
happiness, your gratitude will give a thousand graces
to your conduct; whilst the purity of your manners,
and the nice honour of your life, will gain you the
approbation of those, whose praise is fame.</p>

<p><i>Oliv.</i> Pretty and matronly! thank you, my dear.
We have each struck a bold stroke to-day;&mdash;yours
has been to reclaim a husband, mine to get one: but
the most important is yet to be obtained&mdash;the approbation
of our judges.</p>
